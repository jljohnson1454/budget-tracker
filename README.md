# Budget Tracker

## Description
In case of losing connection to the internet, I've set up this application provided by Xandromus on Github, to store a user's data as well as operate as normal without connectivity. With this application, a user can keep track of their expenses as well as viewing the fluctuations over time of said expenses.

## Installation

Luckily, there's no installation needed for this as it has been uploaded to Heroku

## Usage

Simply add or subtract expenses after entering the name and amount. It's very easy to use and if you don't have internet, it'll continue to function with no issue.
